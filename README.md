A health tech company named 'BeHealthy' operates a web platform facilitating interactions between medical professionals and patients nationwide. This platform offers services including appointment scheduling, patient record management, e-prescriptions, and online medicine orders. As 'BeHealthy' and similar companies amass substantial data from these interactions, a significant challenge arises: the medical data generated contains numerous specialized terms and references to diseases and treatments, rendering it incomprehensible to individuals without medical expertise.

In this context, the problem at hand involves devising a solution to automatically extract relevant medical information from textual data sets. Given a dataset containing a plethora of medical text, the task is to develop a system capable of identifying diseases mentioned and their associated treatments, even when expressed implicitly in the text. The goal is to enable meaningful analysis and utilization of this medical data by transforming it into a format accessible to both medical professionals and non-experts.
